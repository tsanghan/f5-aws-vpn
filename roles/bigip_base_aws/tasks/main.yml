## Some initial setup for big ip once we can login.  We need a user for rest calls.  We may also want the default shell
## to be bash, rather than tmsh.  The latter is difficult to use ansible...

# We specifically us the bigip_facts library because it does some checking
#   to seeif bigip is available.  Rather than

- include: modify_admin.yml
